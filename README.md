this exercise is focused on intergrating a program with a mongoDB and using this to process data given for this exercise.   


## NOTE
as of 12-02 22:40 I've concluded that I won't be able to finish it in time, if I havn't stated otherwise in this readme, then the assignment isn't finished.   

I will continue to work on this tommorow.   

main issue is figuring out MongoDB for .net and applying it's fucntions since it doesn't allow for simply making mongodb queries and shooting them into the database...
